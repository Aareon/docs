Title: CPMR1002 - IconUrl Missing (nuspec)
Description: Information on how to remediate the Chocolatey Package Moderation Rule 1002
---

## Issue

The nuspec is missing (or has commented out) the `iconUrl`, which points to an icon image for the underlying software the package is based on. If there is an existing icon/logo for the software, it should be included with the package.

## Recommended Solution

Add `<iconUrl>url_here</iconUrl>` to the nuspec following the [icon guidelines](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CreatePackages#package-icon-guidelines). If your nuspec file is missing this field, you should run `choco new testpkg` and look at the output from that (ensure you have the [latest version of Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages?q=id%3Achocolatey)).

## Reasoning

We really want to see the IconUrl being used. It adds to the quality of the package when it has an icon to show. Some moderators want to see it being used properly, using the RawGit CDN. For further information on how to setup your icon with a Rawgit CDN URL, please see [icon guidelines](https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki/CreatePackages#package-icon-guidelines). It's not as intuitive as you might hope.
